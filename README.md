# Authcord-API
```
# who wrote authcords api?
lithium... I wrote it purely in golang and python 
```

# how do I set it up ?
```
it's rather self explanitory you can simply create a database called Authcord and insert the sql code from the .sql file and put your database password and tokens in the api.go and server.py file then run the both of them and it'll be up and running.:)
